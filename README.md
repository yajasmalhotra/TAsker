<h2>Task Management System for Teaching Assistants</h2>

*(TA)sker*  provides a way for course coordinators or department heads
to assign Teaching Assistants to different tasks, such as but not limited to:
- Labs
- Office Hours
- Tutorials
- Exam Invigilation

During this time of online learning, managing schedules for course staff
spread out across the world has become **significantly** harder; *(TA)sker* 
aims to streamline workflows across departments by providing a central assignment
system.

<h1>Diplomacy 210</h1> 

<h2> The classic board game with no twists </h2>

This application is meant to be a mobile implementation of 
*Diplomacy*, a strategy board game which simulates war scenarios in varying
geo-political environments. While there are variations of the game, this
application is centered around the first iteration: **Europe in World War I**.

Since *Diplomacy* is a table-top strategy game which relies on secrecy, 
this application allows the users to pass the device around such that each player
can play their turn without being exposed to moves made by others, thus keeping
the integrity of the game. 

While online versions of *Diplomacy* do exist, they require each player to have
their own device, and in the current atmosphere, it may be quite hard for 
prospective players to get a hold of a real board. Through *Diplomacy 210*, 
players can emulate the experience of playing the game with just one device. 

Players can play as 7 countries that were involved in the first World War :
- England
- France
- Russia
- Germany
- Austria-Hungary
- Italy
- Turkey
